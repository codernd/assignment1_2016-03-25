This SPA allows a user to filter and search through a list of tours and to select tours for purchase by adding in a quantity and date. Multiple tours can be selected and removed and then the selection will be seen in the basket incuding an amount. If the customer makes a mistake the basket items can be removed or the quantity and date amended. There is one bug at the moment and that is when there is more than one item in the basket and you try to remove the item on the tour page rather than the basket. I haven't decided if to disable the remove functionality from the tours page or not.  On the basket page there the total amount is caculated and there is a confirm button. Once the confirm button is selected the user is promted for the required information for the booking such as name and bank details which will be captured in a database later on.  I would also like to add a booking reference number and maybe another page gathering the users booking details and items.  In addition to this the home page would allow a login to see a previous/current booking.  Future addons would be to link in some user experience comments with the various tours.
